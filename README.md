## Introduction

**Namingo Registrar Platform**, built atop [FOSSBilling](https://fossbilling.org/), transforms the system into a comprehensive and open-source [ICANN](https://icann.org/) accredited registrar management system. It provides a powerful and flexible solution for managing domain names as an ICANN accredited registrar, adhering to the stringent standards set by ICANN.

While our platform is primarily designed for FOSSBilling, it can be adapted to work with [WHMCS](https://www.whmcs.com/). Using Namingo, businesses can streamline domain management operations, enhance efficiency, and reduce costs.

**ðŸ“¢ Announcement: We're thrilled to report that all the project's features have been implemented. However, the platform isn't ready for production use just yet. As we continue to refine and expand our services, we aim to provide a seamless experience for our users. Your questions or contributions are always welcome. Thank you for your continued patience and support.**
