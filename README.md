**Indera** aims to develop addons for WHMCS or FOSSBilling, turning these platform into a complete and open-source ICANN accredited registrar management system. The addons will enhance the capabilities of these billing and management systems, allowing them to handle the registration, renewal, and management of domain names as an ICANN accredited registrar. By using these addons, businesses will have access to a powerful and flexible solution for managing their domains and customers, while adhering to the strict standards set by ICANN. The project will enable businesses to streamline their domain management operations, improve efficiency and save costs.
